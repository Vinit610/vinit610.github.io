## A little trip down Macintosh memory lane

I've been a fan of Apple's computers every since 1997, when I started using them in my design classes. Around 2000 I bought my first Mac, a *Power Mac G4* with a 17" Graphite monitor and fell in love. This machine treated me well for about 5 years until I finally gave it away to my younger brother. Through the years I added extra hard drives, increased the memory, swapped in a Superdrive, and updated from OS 9 to OS X Tiger with every major point update in between.

Sometime around 2004 I decided I needed more horsepower to do light video editing. I couldn't afford a Power Mac G5 so I focused on the iMac product line instead. I can remember holding out for months waiting for Apple to update from the lamp-shade form factor to the new slim and white design. And then waiting a few more months until they refreshed these new iMac's. Knowing it's best to wait while Apple irons out hardware kinks associated with a new design.

In February of '05 I finally decided it was time. Went to the Apple Store in the Walden Galleria Mall and looked around. Back in 2005 Apple wasn't putting *Bluetooth modules* in the iMac's as a standard option, so I had to pay extra. I really hate having a wireless keyboard and mouse since they eat batteries, but I wanted the option of Bluetooth in case I needed to wireless sync contacts with my Palm Treo. I also had them double the RAM which was stupid since everyone knows it's more expensive buying memory from Apple. Oh well.
