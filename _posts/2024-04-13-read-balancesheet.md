As investors, it is often important to be able to judge the businesses by looking at their financial statements.

Balance Sheet is 1 of the 3 key financial statements of any company.

#### Balance sheet
It reports what a business/company owns at a specific date/time. It generally consists of assets, liabilities and equity of the business.
 
#### Income statement
It reports how a business/company performed during a specific period. It generally consists of revenues and expenses of the business during the same period.

#### Cash flow statement

It shows the cash movements of the business/company from operating, investing and financing activities.

In this article, I am going to deep dive into the *Balance sheet*.

**Assets** are what a company owns. This includes inventory, investments, debts, IP etc. In other words, it is a good indication of how much capital a business needs to conduct its operations.

**Liabilities** are what your company owes. This includes debt, taxes, loans, accounts payable and wages. In other words, it’s a good indication of the source of the capital to run the business. Equity, Debt or Float ? 

Let’s understand this concept using examples.

Assume there are two businesses. 

1) Pen business 
2) Samosa business

### Pen business 

Suppose it costs 10₹ to make a pen. This includes the cost of all the materials to make a pen.

And suppose the retail store pays the owner 15₹ for this pen, and sells 1460 of such pens each month.

Then, the business will make 87,600₹ per year. Here’s the income statement.


|    Income statement for 1 year    |
| Revenues | 15 * 1460 * 12 = 262,800₹ <br> (15₹/pen, 1460 pens/month, 12 months/year) |
| Costs | 10 * 1460 * 12 = 175,200₹ <br> (10₹/pen, 1460 pens/month, 12 months/year) |
| Profits | 262,800₹ - 175200₹ = 87,600₹ <br> (Revenues - Costs) |
| Margins | 87,600/262,800 * 100 = 33.33%  <br> Profits/Revenues * 100 |

### Samosa business

Each morning, the owner makes 120 samosas and sells them on a busy street corner during lunch time.

Suppose it costs the owner 4₹ to make a samosa. This includes all the ingredients to make a samosa. And suppose the owner sells this samosa for 6₹ a samosa.

Then, this business will also make 87,600₹ a year. Here’s the income statement.


|    Income statement for 1 year    |
| Revenues | 6 * 120 * 365 = 262,800₹ <br> (6₹/samosa, 120 samosas/day, 365 days/year)|
| Costs | 4 * 120 * 365 = 175,200₹ <br> (4₹/samosa, 120 samosas/day, 365 months/year)|
| Profits | 262,800₹ - 175200₹ = 87,600₹ <br> (Revenues - Costs)|
| Margins | 87,600/262,800 * 100 = 33.33%  <br> Profits/Revenues * 100 |


It is very evident that both of these business models are highly simplified. Both the businesses will probably have several other costs like insurance, taxes, operational expenses etc.. But to learn the key concepts, it is useful to study such simplified examples. 

Let’s now dive deeper. Which business do you think is better ? 

As you saw above, both the businesses are making the same annual revenues (262.8K₹), costs (175.2K₹), profits (87,600₹) and margins (~33.33%).

So, economically, both the businesses should be identical, right ? 

The answer is **NO**. Because, even though both businesses make identical profits for their owners, they require different amounts of capital to do so.

That is, these businesses have identical income statements but very different balance sheets.

For example, The pen business requires the owner to put in 14.6K₹ (10₹ * 1460) of capital into the business. Once the owner puts in 14.6K₹, they get to take out 7.3K₹/month (87.6K₹/year) from the business (5₹ profit/pen * 1460 pens).

Similarly, the samosa business requires the owner to put in 480₹ (4₹ * 120) of capital into the business. Once the owner puts in that much capital, they get to take out 240₹ daily (2₹ profit/samosa * 120 samosa) - which adds up to 87.6K₹ over a year.

It is clear that the samosa business is **much better** than the pen business. First, it requires *less* capital (480₹ vs 14.6K₹ for pen business) to produce the same earnings.

Second, The samosa business turns the capital **daily** vs the pen business’s **monthly** schedule. Allowing it to take out 240₹ daily vs 7.3K₹ a month (of pen business). 

That is why we should study all the financial statements of the business - not just the income statement. In particular, studying the “Asset” side of the balance sheet tells us how much capital a business needs to conduct its operations.

Here's the asset side of the pen business, as the business goes through various cycles.

As we can see that Asset side of the Balance Sheet NEVER drop below 14.6K₹ - the "minimum" amount of capital the business needs to function.

Compare that to the assets on Samosa business's Balance Sheet. And here we immediately realise that samosa business only needs 480₹ to function - very less compared to the pen business. High quality businesses require only a small amount of "assets" per dollor of **earnings** produced.

As said earlier, Asset side (Cash, inventory, receivables, investments etc..) of the business explains how much capital does a business need to function. On the other hand, every balance sheet also has a liability side (Equity, Debt or Float) which tells us **where** all this capital in the business is coming from.

Equity is the capital put up by business owners. Debt is capital borrowed by the business. Float is the capital provided by suppliers, employees, government, customers etc.. typically for free.

Since Assets and Liabilities is the same way of showing the same amount of capital in different ways, they both always add up to the same value in any company's balance sheet.

Here's a real world example of the company Zomato. As you can see that Assets and Liabilities come out as the same total.

**Note**: Zomato doesn't have any equity until March, 2021 as they only IPOed in July, 2021.

Given both sides are the same, so why should someone even learn about the liabilities side of the business ?

The answer is that businesses can boost their returns for shareholders if they are deploying someone else's capital (aka Float) into the business. High debt is bad in the high interest rate environment. 

That's it. You get the jist. Thanks for reading..
